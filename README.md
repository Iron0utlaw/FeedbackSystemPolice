# Problem Statement 1

## Problem

Getting feedback on police operations is difficult due to outdated methods and privacy concerns. Traditional ways like inspections and calls to complainants are restricted and lack inclusivity. This hampers understanding community feelings and addressing policing issues effectively.

### Background

Current feedback methods are non-digital, missing guest records, and lack a uniform tracking system. Limited manpower inhibits daily follow-up, and the diverse, less digitally aware community adds complexity. Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for model police stations highlight the need for regular feedback to improve transparency and efficiency.

### Challenges

- Non-digital method.
- Lack of uniform guest records.
- Inadequate staff for daily follow-up.
- Multi-lingual and digitally less-literate society.

## Solution

Design a user-friendly, cost-effective Police Feedback System incorporating:

- Bulk SMS Tool: Gather quick comments on experiences (Happy/Not Happy).
- Auto Chatbot: Engage users with questions and compile answers in real-time.
- Online Portal: Record detailed comments for a holistic view.
- Social Media-Like Platform: Allow users to share experiences, tagging specific places for easy categorization.

### Expectations

- User-Friendly: A simple, intuitive system for different tech proficiencies.
- Mobile-Friendly: Optimize for mobile use.
- Cost-Effective: Keep costs within 2-5K per spot.
- Simplicity: Easy for users to provide comments.
- Auto Data Entry: Regularly collect data for efficient monitoring.

This Police Feedback System aims to improve transparency and efficiency by providing an accessible, real-time platform for community members to share their experiences and feedback on police interactions.
